<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="images/ipad-screenshot.png" />

Issues tracking software is essential for managing businesses, but it's not usually tailored for developers and lacks some important functionalities. I know that this project isn't the most features-packed one, but you should give it a try.

Here's why:

- Just like a normal issues tracking software you can create teams and easily assign issues to different team members.
- You can connect your application to your account using a script then anytime an error popup to one of your users a new ticket will be created.
- It's free, open-source, and has an amazing user experience.

Other features will be useful to have, and guess what? I will be constantly adding new features all the time. also if you want to contribute to this project <a href="#contributing">here is how</a>.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Here is how you can connect your application to your issues to track your application errors in real-time.

On any page in your application or `index.html` if it is a single page application (React, Vue, etc) insert the following `Javascript` code:

```
<script>
  window.onerror = function (msg, url, lineNo, columnNo, err) {
    fetch("https://notify-issue-tracker.herokuapp.com/api/bugs", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({
        apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
        bug: {
          message: msg,
          error: JSON.stringify(err.stack),
        },
      }),
      headers: {
        "content-type": "application/json",
      },
    });
  };
</script>
```
